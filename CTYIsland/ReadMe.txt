     Hello, and welcome to my CTYIsland folder! I am writing this late Wednesday night, getting
my work up on GitHub. You're welcome to look through the programs I have here, though I hope to
get them better organized and commented over the course of Thursday, early afternoon. 

     CTYIsland was a text-based game dreamed up by a friend of mine over the summer before my
junior year of high school, and I attempted to make it into a 2D RPG as a final project for my
AP Computer Science course. I used the AP course's Gridworld program as my base, and modified
it as I needed. The most recent version is CTYIsland 3, which will run if you compile it. 

     Like I said, you are free to look through my files as you want, though they will become 
more organized as Thursday goes on. 

Thank you for looking at my work,

Gabriel McDonald
